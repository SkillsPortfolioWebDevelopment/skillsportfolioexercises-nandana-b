                    <h2><u>SUMMARY : </u></h2>
                    The Storm came without warning and wiped out 98 percent of the world's population in a flash. Poof. Adios. Sayonara. Then came the monsters,
                    wave after wave, night after night. Destroying everything in their path. But it's not all doom and gloom. In an abandoned missile silo, we've
                    found one of our first weapons against the Storm you. We're looking for a few good commanders like you to help make a difference, push back the
                    storm and protect those among us who are unable to protect themselves. Explore the world. Rescue survivors. Make hundreds of guns, swords, and things
                    that go boom. Make impregnable forts. Tastefully decorate with sniper perches, poison gas traps, and jump pads. Take back the world. You know, the usual.
                    And be sure to invite your friends. Welcome to Fortnite.

                    <h2><u>REVIEWS.</u></h2>
                    <b>1.</b> I have played this game since it came out. I love the skins and quality of the gameplay, it is so smooth.
                    And then the quality and physics of the weapons is just insane. People always say that they copied Player Unknown Battle Grounds.
                    But no one is copying anybody, it is just a battle royal game that got really popular. And then there's these parents that say that there
                    kids are getting violent. Well that's the parents fault for not taking care of their kid properly. I just don't get these people. But overall,
                    this is a great game and I love it..<br /><br />
                    <b>2.</b> This game was cool at the start but than got lame not because of boredom its the game. The updates are the same and sessions its now
                    the same thing over and over this game will die/ is dead but there's way better games out there like Warzone, Minecraft, Dying light a very under
                    rated game, and Conan Exiles also very under rated game. So if your reading this try these games out and if you have what did you think about them.
