                    <b>1.</b> This is a fine battle Royale game. It is almost like Fortnite. Except it has blood and players can take pain killers,
                    energy drinks and adrenaline syringes and last of all it is very Adictive and when people lose it can make<br /> them a bit aggresive but
                    if your kid doesn't have anger issues I would say it's fine for kids 11+. Violence - 7/10, Language - none, Drugs - 4/10.<br /><br />
                    <b>2.</b> Helloo.I had downloaded the game Pubg from playstore and I have been playing the game for almost 1 year, so I liked the concept of this game very much.
                    In this game you get many types of weapons and along with many interesting maps have been given in which you can play very easily.
                    The help and support of this game is also very good and the company keeps giving new updates in it all the time.
                    You can also play this game in group and you also get to see many new events.
                    Overall, the game is very good, you can show your interest in it.
                    Thank You .
