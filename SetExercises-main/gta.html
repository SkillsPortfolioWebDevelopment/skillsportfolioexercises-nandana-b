                    <h2><u>SUMMARY : </u></h2>
                    Welcome to Vice City. Welcome to the 1980s. Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security,
                    Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City,
                    so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City.
                    He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians
                    stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular
                    pleasures to suit every taste. For the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman, a powerboat or a golf buggy
                    lets you enjoy the great outdoors. For those that need that sense of freedom and escape, why not charter a helicopter and see the beauty of Vice City
                    from the air?

                    <h2><u>REVIEWS.</u></h2>
                    <b>1.</b>I am amazed how parents and kids are rating this game as 12+ and 13+... And on top of that as a "great game".
                    Hello?? This game promotes violence, thievery, burglar, murder, cussing... What are you teaching?? Even an adult, out of sense of moral,
                    shouldn't be playing this "game"..<br /><br />
                    <b>2.</b> This game seems pretty bad for children, but if you teach them that the stuff in the game is bad there is a high probability
                    that they won’t do it in the real world, and if you sometimes play the game with your kid you can feel how they will act and you can learn
                    what your kid is playing.
